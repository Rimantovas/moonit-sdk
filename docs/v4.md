## Change log


### Extend `Token` class with `PreloadedToken`

We have added `PreloadedToken` class that extends in it's functionality from `Token`. On initialization the `PreloaedToken` will fetch all necessary data from chain so operations like getting expected price can be done syncronously.

This can enable use cases where bots makes want to find best price point to buy and sell without compromising on speed when the curve position is known.

Example:
```typescript
import { Environment, FixedSide, Moonshot } from '@wen-moon-ser/moonshot-sdk';

const moonshot = new Moonshot({
	rpcUrl: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com',
	environment: Environment.DEVNET,
});

const token = moonshot.Token({mintAddress:'9ThH8ayxFCFZqssoZmodgvtbTiBmMoLWUqQhRAP89Y97'});

// preload chain data to avoid async calls
const pToken = await token.preload();

const curvePos = await token.getCurvePosition();

const collateralAmount = pToken.getCollateralAmountByTokensSync({
	tokenAmount,
	tradeDirection: 'BUY',
	curvePosition: curvePos,
});
```
